# Object-Oriented Programming

## Fundamentals
- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects that interact with each other to perform program functions.

## Basic Principles of OOP
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## Encapsulation
- Bundling of data and the methods operating on the data into a single unit.
- The ability of an object to hide the internal structure of its properties and methods.

## Abstraction
- Objects should provide a simplified, abstract version of their implementations.
- Only the most relevant features of the object will be presented.

## Inheritance
- Mechanism of defining parent-child relationship between classes.
- Objects are very similar, so inheritance allows programmers to reuse common logic and at the same time introduce unique concepts into the classes.

## Polymorphism
- Means "having many forms".
- Allows programmers to define different implementations for the same method.

## Objects
- Is the key notation for OOP.
- Is an individual instance of a class.
- Attribute: Characterize the states or data of an object.
- Methods: Characterize its behavior.

## Classes
- Individual objects have similar characteristics, we can say these objects belong to the same type or class.
- A class describes a common structure of similar objects.
