Certainly, let's break down the key points:

1. **Class Definition:**
   - Use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon to define a class.
   - The body of the class is indented and contains attributes and methods.
   - In this case, the `pass` statement is a placeholder for an empty class body.

   ```python
   class Person:
       pass
   ```

2. **Instantiation:**
   - Create an instance (object) of the class by using the class name followed by parentheses.

   ```python
   person_instance = Person()
   ```

3. **Verification and Output:**
   - Confirm the type of the object to ensure it's an instance of the specified class.

   ```python
   print(type(person_instance))
   ```

   - Output: `<class '__main__.Person'>`, indicating the type and module.

4. **Memory Address:**
   - The memory address (e.g., `<__main__.Person object at 0x...>`) is the location where the object is stored.
   - It uniquely identifies the object's position in memory.
   - Useful for debugging or understanding memory management but not typically used in regular code.

In summary, the process involves defining a class, creating an instance, verifying its type, and observing the memory address where the object is stored. 
These steps form the foundation for working with classes and objects in Python.
