This script demonstrates the creation of a full name by combining first and last names.

Usage:
1. Set the `first_name` variable to the desired first name.
2. Set the `last_name` variable to the desired last name.
3. The script will create a `full_name` by concatenating `first_name` and `last_name`.
4. The result will be printed to the console.

Example:
first_name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
print(full_name)  # Output: Ada Lovelace
"""

first_name = "Ada"
last_name = "lovelace"
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"

print(full_name)
